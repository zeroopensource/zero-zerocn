# ZeroCN

A community-driven, batteries-included shadcn registry made by Zero.
This registry provides a curated collection of reusable components, utilities, primitives, hooks, layouts, themes, and backend-ready modules — all installable directly into your project, just like shadcn/ui.

ZeroCN is designed for teams who want to install code, not packages — enabling full ownership, version control, and customizability across both frontend and backend layers.

## 🚀 Features

- **Installable source code** — no `node_modules` dependency clutter.
- **Supports both UI and non-UI components** (backend modules, hooks, utils, and more).
- **Typed, framework-friendly, and framework-agnostic** where possible.
- **Supports multi-file complex components** and single-file primitives.
- **Extensible registry** with clearly defined item types.
- **Perfect for monorepos** and codebases wanting in-source installs like shadcn.
